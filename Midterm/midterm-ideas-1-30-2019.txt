Idea for STAT180 midterm (1-30-2018)
====================================

What should they have learned?

- Working with numbers and arrays, and tables

Write a function pick_kth(x, k) That takes as its argument an array x
and an int k and returns an array containing every k-th element of x

Compute pivot table for given data table
Compute a conditional distribution

Interpretation of histogram

Sketch conditional mean

Write a function that returns the k-th largest element of a feature in
a table and returns the smallest element if the number of elements is
< k

Add a column to a table that's the row average

Add a row to a table that's the row average

Transpose a table

For the bay data, write a function that computee the consitional mean
of beith weight for given maternal age and returns np.nan is there are
no mothers with this maternal age.

scatterplot of maternal pregnany weight v Matenal Height.Sketch the
conditional mean curve

Compute mean birth weight of smokers

Hw would you compute the mean differenec between the birthweights for
children of smokers and children of non-smokers?

Write a function that counts the number of births for which both gets
days and birthweights are > median
