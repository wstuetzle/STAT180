    "### Course description\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction to Data Science (IDS) is a survey course introducing the\n",
    "essential elements of data science: data collection and management;\n",
    "summarizing and visualizing data; basic ideas of statistical\n",
    "inference; machine learning. Students will gain hands-on experience\n",
    "using the Python programming language and Jupyter notebooks. IDS can be viewed as a hybrid between a computing course focused on programming and algorithms and a statistics course focusing on estimation and inference. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many important decisions made by individuals and society at\n",
    "  large are or should be data driven. Therefore, understanding the\n",
    "  fundamentals of data science is essential for functioning as an\n",
    "  informed citizen.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basic understanding and hands-on experience with manipulating,\n",
    "  analyzing, and presenting data are increasingly important during \n",
    "  education and in the workplace.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Students completing STAT 180 should be able to\n",
    "* list the steps involved in data science from data acquisition to\n",
    "  insight and describe the role of each step;\n",
    "\n",
    "* distinguish different ways of collecting data and their impact on the\n",
    "  conclusions that can be drawn from the data;\n",
    "\n",
    "* manage, summarize and visualize data using the Python\n",
    "  programming language and Jupyter notebooks;\n",
    "\n",
    "* explain the basic concepts of statistial inference and\n",
    "  implement simulation based inference methods;\n",
    "\n",
    "* apply machine learning methods and assess the quality of\n",
    "  predictions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Target audience\n",
    "\n",
    "All undergraduates, not just students with primary interest in science\n",

    "MATH 103, a score of 151-169 on the MPT-GS placement test, or score of\n",
    "145-153 on the MPT-AS placement test.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approximate time allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction to Python; data management, description, visualization: 4 weeks\n",

    "your needs in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a\n",
    "temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires\n",
    "accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health,\n",
    "attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health\n",
    "impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924 or\n",
    "uwdrs@uw.edu or disability.uw.edu. DRS offers resources and\n",
    "coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities\n",
    "and/or temporary health conditions.  Reasonable accommodations are\n",
    "established through an interactive process between you, your\n",
    "instructor(s) and DRS.  It is the policy and practice of the\n",
    "University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning\n",
    "environments consistent with federal and state law.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Academic integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrity is a crucial part of your character and is essential for a successful career. We expect you to demonstrate integrity in STAT 180 and elsewhere. In particular, your assignments must represent your own work and understanding. Academic misconduct such as plagiarism is grounds for failing the class and can be dealt with by a University committee.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following guidelines apply unless an assignment specifically states otherwise. If you have any questions about acceptable behavior, please ask the course staff. We will be happy to answer your questions!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to talk to your classmates about problem solution ideas, and you may reuse those ideas, but you may not examine nor reuse any other student's code - this includes code from students who have taken this course in previous quarters. You are not allowed to copy code from any source â€” other students, acquaintances, the Web, etc. (Copying is forbidden via cut-and-paste, via dictation or transcription, via viewing and memorizing, etc.) Your solution may utilize Python libraries that are available in the Enthought Python distribution. You are encouraged to use books, the Internet, your friends, etc. to get solution ideas, but you may not copy/transcribe/transliterate code: get the idea, close the other resource, and then (after enough time that the idea is in your long-term, not short-term, memory) generate the code yourself based on your own understanding."
