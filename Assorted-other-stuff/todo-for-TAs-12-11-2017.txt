Todo for STAT180 TAs (12-11-2017)
=================================

The progamming language for the course will be Python. We will make
extensive use of Jupyter notebooks. In particular, the students will
do all their computing using notebooks.

=> Familiarize yourself with Python and Jupyter notebooks

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I have not decided yet which notebook server I will use. The most
likely option is the MS server   notebooks.azure.com

=> Familiarize yourself with the login process and the uploading and
   downloading of notebooks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

STAT180 is based on the Data-8 course developed at UC Berkeley.
There is a lot of material on the Web.

The main web page for the course is
   data-8.github.io  which is also accessible as
   data8.org
It has many links, for example to Lecture schedules, lecture slides,

=> Take a look at   https://github.com/data-8/  and  data8.org

-----------------------------------------------------------------

In particular there is the textbook "Foundations of Data Science"
which consists of a collection of Jupyter notebooks. The textbook is
at  https://www.inferentialthinking.com/

=> Take a look at the textbook, especially at the chapters about
   programming with Python ("Programming in Python", "Data Types",...,
   "Randomness")

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I will start the course with a case study - analysis and visualization
of the Titanic data set.

=> Take a look at 
   https://github.com/prabhath6/Data-analysis-of-titanic-using-python

-----------------------------------------------------------------

We will not use Pandas in the course. Instead we will use a module
"datascience"  developed by the Berkeley folks. The source is at
   https://github.com/data-8/datascience.
You can install the module with   pip install datascience
A nice summary of the functionality is at
   https://github.com/wstuetzle/data8assets/blob/gh-pages/exam/data8-sp17-midterm-guide.pdf

=> Familiarize yourself with the "datascience" module

-----------------------------------------------------------------

To get an idea about the homeworks and exams
