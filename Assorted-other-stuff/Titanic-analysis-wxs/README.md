# Data-analysis-of-Titanic-using-Python

In this project I have done data analysis of titanic ship using python.

###Modules used
1.Pandas

2.Numpy

3.Seaborn

4.Matplotlib

###Details

This data analysis projects begin with trying to answer questions.

1.) Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc)

2.) What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?

3.) Where did the passengers come from?

4.) Who was alone and who was with family?

Then we'll dig deeper, with a broader question:

5.) What factors helped someone survive the sinking?

6.) Did the deck have an effect on the passengers survival rate? Did this answer match up with your intuition?

7.) Did having a family member increase the odds of surviving the crash?

All the results for these questions can be visualised from graphs that are plotted using matplotlib and seaborn.

The base data for this project is taken from kaggle's site train.csv
