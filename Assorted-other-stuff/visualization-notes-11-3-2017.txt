Visualizing distributions
-------------------------

1. Univariate distributions
  - Categorical:  barplot (count or relative frequency)
  - Numerical:  histogram, boxplot, violin plot

2. Bivariate distributions
   It may be better to draw two graphs, on showing the marginal of
   V1 and the other showing the conditional of V2|V1.

   Two categorical variables:
   - Barplot of V1 showing frequencies (counts) and grouped barplot of
     V2|V1 showing relative frequencies
   (- Mosaic plot)
   
   One categorical variable V1 and one numerical variable V2:
   - Barplot of V1 showing frequencies and boxplots or violin plots
     showing conditional distribution of V2|V1  or
   - Histogram of V2 and k curves showing conditional probabilities of
     V1 = ci|V2. Curves can be obtained via binning or smoothing

   Two numerical variables:
   - scatterplot, density plot, hexbin plot

We need a version of nested barplot where there is a primary
categorical variable V1 with k1 categories and a secondary categorical
categorical variable with k2 categories. Each of the k1 primary "bars" would
itself be a barplot with k2 bars. The heights of the secondary bars
could encode the conditional of V2 given the particular value of
V1. Or they could encode the values of any function defined for k1*k2
values of (V1, V2). The input should be k1 x k2 table.

We should be able to use tbl.pivot



 
   
   


=================================================================

Look at Titanic data.

The data are in the form of a table. Rows correspond to passengers,
columns correspond to properties (or "features", or "characteristics")
of passengers, like "survival", "age", "cabin class", etc.

For example the first element of the first row...

Our goal here is to "understand" these data. By "understand" we mean
being able to answer questions like

1. what fraction of passengers survived?
2. what fraction of passengers traveled 1st class, 2nd class, 3rd
   class
3. what was the typical age of passengers
4. what was the age distribution?

5. did the likelihood of survical depend on gender (and what exactly
   do we mean by "depend on")?
6. did the likelihood of survival depend on cabin class
7. were women in 1st class cabins more likely to survive than women in
   2nd or 3rd class cabins.
8. did presence of family members on board influence the likelihood of
   survival.

The data table has ???? entries. We will not get the answers to these
questions by staring at the numbers. To gain insight we will have to
compute numerical summaries.

Questions 1..4 are involve individual variables.
Question 5..8 each involve several variables

The meaning of (1) and (2) is obvious. Let's just compute them.

Terminology: "survival" and "cabin class" are categorical variables:
It does not make sense to add or subtract or take averages. We can
encde the possible values as numbers but that does not change.

age is numerical variable - it makes sense to add or subtract or take
an average.

What do we mean by "distribution of a variable". Consider cbin class.


Let's first look at categorical variable taking k different values. let's call
the values v1....vk. The distribution of X
